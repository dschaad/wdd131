        <p>Welcome to the Everwild, an expansive wilderness filled with monsters, treasures, and secrets. The only known civilization is the humble town of Greenhaven, a town located deep within the forest. The people of the town welcome any and all adventures; they enjoy their personalities and business. They have no heart for adventuring themselves and prefer the safe simple life within their close-knit community.</p>

        <p>The Everwild is a West-Marches style campaign for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (5e). It is a game I run as the Dungeon Master (DM) for several of my friends. As the DM, it is on me to create the world and populate it with adventures for my players. During play itself, I serve as the narrator and rulebook, whereas my players serve as the primary drivers of the story. In other words, they decide what they would like to do/attempt, and I explain what, if anything, they need to do to achieve that. This is usually accomplished with rolling dice, but not always. This website serves as an explanation for the specifics of the game, both D&D and West-Marches style campaigns, as well as a place where I can share what my players have accomplished.</p>
