			<h2>Content</h2>
			
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Welcome to the Everwild, an expansive wilderness filled with monsters, treasures, and secrets. The only known civilization is the humble town of Greenhaven, a town located deep within the forest. The people of the town welcome any and all adventures; they enjoy their personalities and business. They have no heart for adventuring themselves and prefer the safe simple life within their close-knit community.</p>
			<p>The Everwild is a West-Marches style campaign for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (5e). It is a game I run as the Dungeon Master (DM) for several of my friends. As the DM, it is on me to create the world and populate it with adventures for my players. During play itself, I serve as the narrator and rulebook, whereas my players serve as the primary drivers of the story. In other words, they decide what they would like to do/attempt, and I explain what, if anything, they need to do to achieve that. This is usually accomplished with rolling dice, but not always. This website serves as an explanation for the specifics of the game, both D&D and West-Marches style campaigns, as well as a place where I can share what my players have accomplished.</p>
			
			<h3>Players</h3>
			<p>Due to the nature of the game, players' strength, generally represented by their level and experience points, can vary depending on how frequently someone plays and what they manage to accomplish in a session. Below is a list of all of the players who have at least created a character to play. Those that have more experience are listed first.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Zelfina the Half-Elf Paladin, played by Rach.</li>
				<li>Lyra the Elf Warlock, played by Megan.</li>
				<li>Lorilla the Gnome Sorcerer, played by Shae.</li>
				<li>Tumblefoot the Halfling Rogue, played by Darrell.</li>
				<li>Loralee the Elf Rogue, played by Kristina.</li>
				<li>Astoria the Arakocra Fighter/Rogue, played by Shayna.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>West Marches Explained (will add if I have time)</h3>
			<p>West Marches is a sandbox style of D&D campaign, created by Ben Robbins and popularized by Matt Colville, designed to facilitate player agency and reduce ‘mindless plot following’ by putting a larger group of players in charge of where they go, what they do, and when they play. Ben Robbins has several articles detailing how he ran his campaign, though admittedly my campaign is run quite differently. Still, for anyone interested in learning more, you can find his articles <a href="https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/">here</a>. For those wanting to learn more about West-Marches without wanting to read, I've included a link to a YouTube video by Matt Colville <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAC-gBoX9k">here</a> as well, in which he explains how the game is generally ran and played without going too deep into specifics.</p>
			<p>For those wanting a brief summary of how I run my campaign, instead of an overarching story and consistent party of characters, players decide among themselves where to go, who to go with, and what to do in a wide expanse of dangerous wilderness. Here are the most important things to remember:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There are no invisible barriers or level requirements for going into areas. As such, players may find themselves against foes outside of their capabilities.</li>
				<li>Every session starts from the central town (Greenhaven) and ends with the players returning to town.</li>
				<li>Monsters will generally be more dangerous the further away they are from town.</li>
				<li>Outside of the quest board, adventure is only found outside of town.</li>
				<li>Scheduling is done primarily by players who then coordinate with the DM (me).</li>
			</ul>
