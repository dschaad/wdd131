        <p>Due to the nature of the game, players' strength, generally represented by their level and experience points, can vary depending on how frequently someone plays and what they manage to accomplish in a session. Below is a list of all of the players who have at least created a character to play. They are displayed in order of experience, then alphabetically by character name. Feel free to adjust any player's experience points and corresponding level, but please note that any changes made will not be permanent.</p>
